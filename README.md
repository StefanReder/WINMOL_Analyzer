# WINMOL Analyzer

**WINMOL Analyzer** is an open-source QGIS plugin for the **detection and quantification of windthrown tree stems** on UAV-derived orthomosaics. It leverages deep learning and heuristics to identify, reconstruct, and quantify individual fallen trees, supporting salvage operations and sustainable forest management following storm events.

## 🌪️ Purpose

Severe storms are a major driver of biomass loss in European forests. Knowing the **amount** and **spatial distribution** of windthrown trees is essential for:
- Supporting the planning of salvage operations,
- Reduing the risk of accidents,
- Reducing follow-up biotic, abiotic, and economic damages,
- Supporting sustainable forestry and conservation strategies.

## 🛠️ Features

- Deep learning-based object detection using U-Net
- Skeletonization algorithm for stem detection
- Morphological heuristics for occluded stem reconstruction
- Diameter measurement every 25 cm along each stem
- Volume estimation via truncated cone modeling
- Pre-trained models for **Spruce**, **Beech**, and **General** (mixed stands)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [QGIS 3.x](https://qgis.org/) (recommended: latest LTR version)
- Recommended: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 8.x support or above
- [CUDA Drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) and [CdDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/installation/latest/windows.html)

### Installation as QGIS Plugin

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/your-repo/releases) (a `.zip` file of the plugin)
2. In QGIS, go to **Plugins** > **Manage and Install Plugins**
3. Click the **Install from ZIP** tab
4. Browse to the downloaded `.zip` file and click **Install Plugin**

Once installed, the plugin will be available via the **Plugins** menu.

### Load and Use the Plugin

1. Select an UAV orthomosaic as input file (preferably <3 cm GSD) and set an output file path
2. Select a pre-trained model (**Spruce**, **Beech** or **General**) or a **Custom** model
3. Otional: Adjust the parameters
4. Run detection and quantification
5. The results are exported as geojson and added to the canvas
